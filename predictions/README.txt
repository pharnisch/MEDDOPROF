SYSTEM
For each of NER and CLASS, I use a flair SequenceTagger with a stacked embedding
(pretrained on spanish language: word-embedding, flair-embedding-forward, flair-embedding-backward).
For NORM, I use the SequenceTagger trained for NER to find all occupation mentions.
For the second part, calculate the distance between strings and all valid strings, to then take the nearest.
